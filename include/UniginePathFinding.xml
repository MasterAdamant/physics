			Depending on the type of the navigation area, the function performs the following:											For navigation sectors, it checks whether the given point is inside the navigation sector. 					The height of the navigation sector (Z coordinate) is ignored.						For navigation meshes, it checks whether the given point is inside the navigation mesh and the distance from the point to the mesh is in range [-height;height].
